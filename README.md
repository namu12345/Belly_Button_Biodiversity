## Overview
Biomanufacturing food company Improbable Beef is looking for people who carry a large number of a certain bacterial species. They have enlisted the assistance of a bio-research firm to create a web-based dashboard where research volunteers could quickly identify whether they are eligible to sell their bacteria to Improbable Beef. Specifically, the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species they hosted. The goal of this dashboard is to sort the most common species of bacteria and then display the results on the webpage.

## Resources
- JavaScript [charts.js](https://github.com/namu12345/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/main/static/js/charts.js)
- D3.js 
- Plotly
- HTML [index.html](https://github.com/namu12345/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/main/index.html)
- Json data [samples.json](https://github.com/namu12345/Belly_Button_Biodiversity/blob/main/samples.json)

## Results
The final product allows the research volunteers to choose their Test Subject ID from a dropdown menu, which will display the volunteer's demographic information.

A bar graph is displayed that shows the top 10 bacterial cultures found on the research volunteer. Volunteers can hover their cursor over each bar to see which bacterial cultures are most prevalent.

Research volunteers will also see a bubble chart that displays bacterial cultures per sample. This chart also allows users to see the prevalence of certain bacterial cultures when they hover their cursor over a bubble.

Lastly, a guage chart is displayed that shows the frequency of washing conducted by the volunteer on a weekly basis.
